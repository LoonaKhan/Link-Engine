# Pokemon Link Engine
 Fanmade pokemon-based game engine built from scratch in Python using pygame.
 Its based on Gen 5 mechanics and graphics(except for 3d aspects).
 for the most part similar to the pokemon games but "better".
 For now, this code will be used to make a game engine, as the name implies. Once that is completed, an actual game with a plot and quests can be worked on.
 
 # Status:
 On hold until further notice. This project was too large scale and I was not experienced enough. I will remake this project sometime later.
 
 ## Aspects of the game to work on
 1. Database
 - this includes all pokemon, moves, abilities etc
 
 2. Battle Mechanics
 
 3. Graphics/Audio
 - Mostly just rendering, animating and overworld/battle sprite behaviour as well as getting audio to work.
 - the actual art/music will be handled by others if need be.

4. Overworld
- How the overworld actually works
- Maps 

5. Other Mechanics
- other minor things such as how to trigger cutscenes etc
