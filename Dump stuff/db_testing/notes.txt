Hierarchy:
    Pokemon:
        species
            shapes(included)
        evolution
    Moves
    Types
    Items:
        berries
    maps:
        location area encounters
            items

pokemon weaknesses are calculated and manually added to the db
no calculations, just lookup tables.
research this more

encounters is in metadata
each pokemon, with their encounter
list of encounters. can have encounters with the same pkmn

research characteristics.
    highest stat/5 and if the remainder is a certain value give the pokemon that stat.
    remove possible values

research forms
    id's?
    forms are listed on the pokemon resource not species

for things that have id's we can list them in that order.
and remove that id resource.

work on all the mechanics and make forms the last part

habitats:
    included in map meta? sure. but its just an entry
    we still manually assign the pokemon there ourselves

dont include pokeathlon stats

evolution, find the evolution chain in species and add it into the species data
    look through all pokemon in the chain and look for the one with the right species and then note down its next evolution details
    every evolution check we look throuh the pokedex entry of said poke and if its entries are satisfied.

massive pokedex file or many entries of all the pokemon as seperate files.

todo:
    a lot of this database will be loaded in memory always, so test out the ram usage
    excludes: pokedex
    make sure to only load it in when necessary
