REMOVE:
    order(unless we gon use a regional/national dex)
    game indices(except gen 5)
    held items
    location area encounters
    past types
    sprites(except animated gen 5 and default)

RESEARCH:
    pokemon that have different forms and defaults. rotom, kyurem and castform. ditto?
    baby pokemon?
        do we even need to keep track? check evolutions
        cannot breed, and are hatched from eggs usually rather than encountered, parent pkmn usually hold an item to hatch the baby pkmn
    evolutions:
        trade based. karrablast(trade with specific pkmn[id:299]), machoke(any[id:27])
        gender based: kirlia([id:140])

            habitat(included)

    Items:
        berries
    maps:
        location area encounters
            items

pokemon weaknesses are calculated and manually added to the db
no calculations, just lookup tables.
research this more

encounters is in metadata
each pokemon, with their encounter
list of encounters. can have encounters with the same pkmn

research characteristics.
    highest stat/5 and if the remainder is a certain value give the pokemon that stat.
    remove possible values

research forms
    id's?
    forms are listed on the pokemon resource not species

for things that have id's we can list them in that order.
and remove that id resource.

work on all the mechanics and make forms the last part

habitats:
    included in map meta? sure. but its just an entry
    we still manually assign the pokemon there ourselves

dont include pokeathlon stats

evolution, find the evolution chain in species and add it into the species data
    look through all pokemon in the chain and look for the one with the right species and then note down its next evolution details
    every evolution check we look throuh the pokedex entry of said poke and if its entries are satisfied.

massive pokedex file or many entries of all the pokemon as seperate files.
    when referencing another pokemon(what it evolves into for example) dowe reference the name or the id?


649 pokemon
the final api call script should take about 11 mins to execute. since we shall delay a second between each pokemon.
13-15 if we include the writes as well as any bottlenecks or lag from either end
pokeapi call rules
test the script for 1 pokemon and check the file size.


todo:
    a lot of this database will be loaded in memory always, so test out the ram usage
    excludes: pokedex
    make sure to only load it in when necessary







============================

issues:

  birth moves?
    how to confirm parents?
    manual?

  mega goes into varieties?


-1 gender rate: genderless



manual:
  if egg move, we can make a log file that logs which pokemon and what moves to add.
  if machine,
    when using a machine, keep the machine move name and compare to the pokemon in question. if the move can be learned and by machine, learn it.
  script to modify the database?




global poke vars:
  id
  species
  varieties
    forms

characteristics?

formed pokemon
