have a script
with all text
have conversations
maybe instead each conversation is its own json. its easier
all entries are numbered and if there are different paths of conversation they and all their trailing convos are labelled as #letter
EX: 1,2,3,4a,4b,4c,5a,5b,5c. 
if the branched entries end, then move onto the next numbered entry

json:
starts a dialogue prompt. dialogue = True?
for each entry in conversation:
display character and their image and play their talking sound every 0.1(set as ${talking_speed}) seconds also display ${line} as text.
if player_input in entry:
execute player_input
player input can be either a prompt window(asks the name or something else) or can be a number of options

{
	"//conversation": "convos are basically text boxes in big chunks. each line is an entry in here"
	"conversation":{
		"1": {
			"speaker": "character",
