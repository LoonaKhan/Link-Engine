map metadata files are revamped
-renamed variable names to be more intuitive
-made a template meta file
-made a full template meta map layout (issue: backdrop edge detection makes the fps drop hard)

draws player at gate locations upon entering a new area instead of the middle
-need to work on backdrop movement checking
-otherwise the player was drawn at a distance from the gate

added a dialogue system
-plan to allow textboxes can be customized with an added json and external files(png for textbox, font and colour)
-made progress on audio, but linux audio drivers are problematic
